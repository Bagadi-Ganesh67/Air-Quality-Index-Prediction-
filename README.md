Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Model

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on air pollutant concentrations using machine learning techniques in Python. The model utilizes real-world air quality datasets to estimate AQI levels, helping in monitoring pollution and taking preventive measures.
